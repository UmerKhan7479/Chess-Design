# Chess Design
 This HTML code creates a table with a chessboard pattern using `<table>` and `<tr>` for rows and `<td>` for cells. Each cell has a fixed height and width, displaying chess piece images (`<img>`) with specific backgrounds (`bgcolor`). The chess pieces are represented by various images set within each cell, creating a visual chessboard layout.
